        <h1>The Story of <span class="highlight">DeputyMods</span></h1>
        <p>
            DeputyMods began as a dream to contribute to the GTA V modding community, 
            and thanks to <span class="highlight">Geoffrey_Gamer</span>, it became a reality. 
            This is the story of our journey.
        </p>

        <h2>Who is <span class="highlight">Geoffrey_Gamer</span>?</h2>
        <p>
            Geoffrey_Gamer is a well-known content creator who has helped countless modders succeed 
            in the LSPDFR and GTA V communities with his tutorials and showcases.
        </p>

        <h2>The Turning Point</h2>
        <p>
            On August 26, 2024, Geoffrey released a video featuring our mods. Overnight, 
            downloads skyrocketed, and DeputyMods found its audience.
        </p>

        <h2>DeputyMods Today</h2>
        <p>
            Without Geoffrey_Gamer’s support, we wouldn’t be here. His guidance remains a 
            cornerstone of our success.
